# graph-relational-benchmark [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/167941993.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/167941993)

A fork to use docker for the deployment, there will be three containers :
- the benchmark web application
- the neo4j database
- the sql server database
It will be launch through a docker-compose

This project enables you to benchmark graph and relational databases to compare their performance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

To be able to connect to the Microsoft SQL database that will be created using the creation scripts below,
there is a need to set up a Microsoft SQL Server on your local computer.

Neo4j Desktop Client also needs to be installed to be able to query the created Neo4j database, it can be downloaded [here](https://neo4j.com/download/ "Download Neo4j").

## Project setup

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install required dependencies for both python and node

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

Add environment variables into a .env file

```
# .env
SQL_SERVER=XXXXXX (e.g. 8ZC5G31)
```

### Initiate the databases and populate them with data
To create the Microsoft SQL Server database, run the following

```
sqlcmd -i "backend/api/db/out/sql/create_db.sql"
```

Neo4j databases are easiest created in the Neo4j desktop client by clicking 'Projects' -> 'New' -> 'Add Graph' -> 'Start'.

The web app will automatically connect to the Neo4j database that is currently running.

> **! Important**: Remove (comment out) the config option: `dbms.directories.import=import` from Neo4j -> Database -> Settings before population the graph database with fake data.

To populate the databases with fake data, run the following

```
npm run setup
```

This script runs `reset_sql.sh -u && reset_cypher.sh` in the `backend/api/db` folder.

> **Note**: Only the first data population command needs the argument -u, as it creates the data which will be used to populate both databases. Nothing bad will happen if -u is provided to both scripts, the process will just take twice as long.

## Starting the web app and the django server

To start the development server, run 

```
npm start
```

which will start the web app at http://localhost:8080 as well as starting the backend server.

In the web app, pressing a tab and the 'refresh'-button will run the query shown at the bottom of the page a given amount of times.

The amount of query runs can be specified through the tab 'Configuration' -> Specify Query Amount -> 'Save'.

> **Note**: Some queries, e.g. the queries in the 'documents' and 'histories' tab take a very long time and can therefore only be run a few times without the request timing out.


## Query Complexity Analysis

To analyse the complexity of the queries that are used for the benchmark, run the following command:

```
./complexity_analyzer.sh cypher_argument sql_argument
```

Where cypher_argument and sql_argument are the queries that are to be compared, e.g. 

```
./complexity_analyzer.sh match select
```

will compare the complexity of the cypher match queries that correspond to the select queries in SQL.
